# Project Setup
Sit Circle uses CocoaPods for all frameworks.  After you clone / fork the repo, you will need to install the required frameworks by using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).  Once you have run `pod install`, be sure to always use the .xcworkspace file when opening the project in Xcode.
